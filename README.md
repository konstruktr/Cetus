# Cetus
Cetus 1.0, the Thinking Buildings IoT node for sensing and controlling the near-human indoor environment. Cetus can attach to third-party sensors or automation, and provide cloud connections and go to deep sleep to conserve power when needed. Perfect for sensing and intelligence inside walls and objects. 

Cetus can retrofit existing BMS equipment and enable new services via a secure software upgrade. It is a satellite for the building supercomputer (c3Pio) and can connect securely over one converted IT network.  

 Cetus is a highly cost optimized ultra-low-power wireless sensors node. It is credit card sized and designed for low-priced production and deployments. 

 We are using Texas Instruments 802.11 (WiFi), It has an on-board high-res Analog-to-Digital Converter (TI ADS1220) and lots of Input/Output (I/O) for environment sensing and control.
