This is 'Cetus', a board using Texas Instruments 802.11 (WiFi) for creating an ultra-low-power wireless sensor node. 
Credit-card sized, it can run off 2xAAA cells or alternative sources. 
It has an on-board high-res Analog-to-Digital Converter (TI ADS1220) and lots of Input/Output (I/O) for environment sensing and control.
